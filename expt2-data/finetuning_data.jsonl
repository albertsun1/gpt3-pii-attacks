Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.\n\nIndeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.\n\nThe New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEli Long END"}

Some variables \nshow significant correlated with ENE stock during particular time periods, \nbut most of those correlation disappears when we tested them over different \nor longer time periods.  \nOnly two variables, S&P Utility Index(SPXU) and  DOW Jones Utility \nIndex(UTIL), show stable and significant relationship with ENE stock (a \nsummary of these relationship can be found in the attached file \n\"outputSummary\").
